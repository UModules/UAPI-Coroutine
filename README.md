# UAPI Coroutine üöÄ
UAPI Coroutine is a C# library designed to manage asynchronous API calls and processes within Unity using `IEnumerator`. This package leverages Unity's coroutine system to handle tasks that would otherwise require complex callback handling.

‚ú® If you prefer using UniTask for asynchronous operations, we also offer a version of this package that integrates with `UniTask`. You can find it [here](https://github.com/UModules/UAPI).

## Features üåü
* **Coroutine-Based Operations:** Simplifies handling of asynchronous API requests using `IEnumerator`.
* **Modular Design:** Flexible and customizable to fit into a variety of Unity projects.
* **Seamless Integration:** Works naturally with Unity's existing coroutine system, without needing to introduce `async/await` or `Task`.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
### Git URL üåê
UAPI Coroutine supports Unity Package Manager. To install the project as a Git package, follow these steps:
1. In Unity, open `Window -> Package Manager`.
2. Press the `+` button and choose **Add package from git URL...**.
3. Enter `"https://github.com/UModules/UAPI-Coroutine.gitupm"` and press **Add**.

### Unity Package üì¶
Alternatively, you can add the code directly to your project:
1. Clone the repo or download the latest release.
2. Add the UAPI Coroutine folder to your Unity project or import the `.unitypackage`.

### Manifest File üìÑ
To install via git URL by editing the `manifest.json`, add this entry:

`"com.useffarahmand.uapi-coroutine": "https://github.com/UModules/UAPI-Coroutine.git#upm"`

## Usage üìñ
### Sample Usage üéÆ
To see how UAPI Coroutine works, you can explore the sample provided:
1. Open Unity and load the `Sample/Scenes/APISample.unity` scene.
2. Run the sample to see how API requests are handled asynchronously using coroutines.

### Custom Request Function üîß
To demonstrate how to use UAPI Coroutine, here's a simple function that sends a request and handles the response:
```C#
private void OnRequest()
{
    APIClient.CreateAndSendRequest(/*APIConfigData*/,
                                   /*RequestScreenConfig*/,
                                   /*RequestSendConfig*/,
                                   Response);

    void Response(NetworkResponse response)
    {
        if (response.isSuccessful)
        {
            Debug.Log($"Response: {response.ToString()}");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogError("Request failed: " + response.errorMessage);
        }
    }
}
```
#### Key Classes and Configurations:
3. **`APIConfigData`:** Configuration data for the API request. This includes the base URL, endpoint, HTTP method, headers, and other request settings.
4. **`RequestScreenConfig`:** Configuration for managing the display of network-related screens during API requests, including options for showing, hiding, or customizing screens based on the network state or response.
5. **`RequestSendConfig`:** Configuration for sending the API request, including properties for the request body (as a JSON object or string), request headers, a path suffix, and an access token, along with methods to determine if the request contains a body or a path suffix.
6. **`Response(NetworkResponse response)`:** The callback function that handles the API response. It checks whether the response is successful, and logs the result accordingly.
