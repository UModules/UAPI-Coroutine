# UAPI
# Description
UAPI Coroutine is a C# library developed by UModules, aimed at simplifying API development and integration using Coroutines for asynchronous operations. It provides tools and utilities for creating, managing, and consuming APIs, making it easier for developers to build robust and scalable applications without the need for UniTask.

# Features
* **Coroutine-based Asynchronous Operations:** Leverages Unity's coroutines instead of UniTask for handling async tasks.
* **Easy Integration:** Simplifies API integration in Unity applications.
* **Modular Architecture:** A highly modular design that allows for easy customization and extension.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation to help you get started quickly.
